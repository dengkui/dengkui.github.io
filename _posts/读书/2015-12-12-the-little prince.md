<li>
Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept. I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true understanding. But, whoever it 
was, he, or she, would always say:"That is a hat." Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars. I would bring myself down to his level. I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties. And the grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man.

"One day," you said to me, "I saw the sunset forty-four times!" 

And a little later you added: 
**"You know-- one loves the sunset, when one is so sad..."** 

"Were you so sad, then?" I asked, "on the day of the forty-four sunsets?" 

But the little prince made no reply.

<li>
It is such a secret place, the land of tears.

<li>The little prince also pulled up, with a certain sense of dejection, the last little 
shoots of the baobabs. He believed that he would never want to return. But on this 
last morning all these familiar tasks seemed very precious to him. And when he 
watered the flower for the last time, and prepared to place her under the shelter of 
her glass globe, he realised that he was very close to tears.

<li>"Then you shall judge yourself," the king answered. "that is the most difficult 
thing of all. *It is much more difficult to judge oneself than to judge others.* If you 
succeed in judging yourself rightly, then you are indeed a man of true wisdom." 

<li> Conceited people never hear anything 
but praise. 

<li>
And then he added: 
"Go and look again at the roses. You will understand now that yours is unique 
in all the world. Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a 
present of a secret." 
The little prince went away, to look again at the roses. 

"You are not at all like my rose," he said. "As yet you are nothing. No one has 
tamed you, and you have tamed no one. You are like my fox when I first knew him. 
He was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But I have made him my 
friend, and now he is unique in all the world." 
And the roses were very much embarrassed. 
"You are beautiful, but you are empty," he went on. "One could not die for you. 
To be sure, an ordinary passerby would think that my rose looked just like you-- the 
rose that belongs to me. But in herself alone she is more important than all the 
hundreds of you other roses: because it is she that I have watered; because it is she 
that I have put under the glass globe; because it is she that I have sheltered behind 
the screen; because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars (except the two or 
three that we saved to become butterflies); because it is she that I have listened to, 
when she grumbled, or boasted, or even sometimes when she said nothing. Because 
she is my rose. 

And he went back to meet the fox. 
"Goodbye," he said. 
"Goodbye," said the fox. "And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: **It is 
only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye.**" 

"What is essential is invisible to the eye," the little prince repeated, so that he 
would be sure to remember. 
"It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so 
important." 
"It is the time I have wasted for my rose--" said the little prince, so that he 
would be sure to remember. 
"Men have forgotten this truth," said the fox. "But you must not forget it. You 
become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed. You are responsible for your 
rose..." 
"I am responsible for my rose," the little prince repeated, so that he would be 
sure to remember. 

<li>
"**The stars are beautiful, because of a flower that cannot be seen.**" 

I replied, "Yes, that is so." And, without saying anything more, I looked across the ridges of sand that were stretched out before us in the moonlight.
 
"The desert is beautiful," the little prince added. 
And that was true. I have always loved the desert. One sits down on a desert 
sand dune, sees nothing, hears nothing. Yet through the silence something throbs, 
and gleams... 

"What makes the desert beautiful," said the little prince, "is that somewhere it 
hides a well..." 

I was astonished by a sudden understanding of that mysterious radiation of the 
sands. When I was a little boy I lived in an old house, and legend told us that a 
treasure was buried there. To be sure, no one had ever known how to find it; perhaps 
no one had ever even looked for it. But it cast an enchantment over that house. My 
home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart... 

"Yes," I said to the little prince. "The house, the stars, the desert-- **what gives 
them their beauty is something that is invisible!**" 

<li>
I raised the bucket to his lips. He drank, his eyes closed. It was as sweet as 
some special festival treat. This water was indeed a different thing from ordinary 
nourishment. Its sweetness was born of the walk under the stars, the song of the 
pulley, the effort of my arms. It was good for the heart, like a present. When I was a 
little boy, the lights of the Christmas tree, the music of the Midnight Mass, the 
tenderness of smiling faces, used to make up, so, the radiance of the gifts I received. 

"The men where you live," said the little prince, "raise five thousand roses in 
the same garden-- and they do not find in it what they are looking for." 

"They do not find it," I replied. 

"And yet what they are looking for could be found in one single rose, or in a 
little water." 

"Yes, that is true," I said. 

And the little prince added: 
"But the eyes are blind. One must look with the heart..."

**"And when your sorrow is comforted (time soothes all sorrows) you will be 
content that you have known me. You will always be my friend. You will want to 
laugh with me. And you will sometimes open your window, so, for that pleasure... 
and your friends w ill be properly astonished to see you laughing as you look up at 
the sky! Then you will say to them, ‘Yes, the stars always make me laugh!‘ And they 
will think you are crazy. It will be a very shabby trick that I shall have played on 
you..."**

And he laughed again. 

"It will be as if, in place of the stars, I had given you a great number of little 
bells that knew how to laugh..."
 
And he laughed again. Then he quickly became serious:
 
"Tonight-- you know... do not come," said the little prince.**
